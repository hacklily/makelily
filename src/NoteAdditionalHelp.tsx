          icon on the toolbar, then insert it as you would a note.

        <h3>What is relative output?</h3>
        <p>
          Use <code>\relative</code> output mode if you are inserting code into
          a <code>\relative</code> block, and leave it unchecked if your song
          uses absolute mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the LilyPond manual, absolute octave entry requires specifying
          the octave for every single note. Relative octave entry, in contrast,
          specifies each octave in relation to the last note: changing one
          noteâ€™s octave will affect all of the following notes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this checkbox is not checked, the octave of every note will be
          explicitly spelled out. <code>c'</code> will always mean middle C.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using this mode, after inserting bars of music, you may need to
          adjust the octave of the first note.

        <h3>What features does this tool have?</h3>
        <p>
          Use this tool to generate LilyPond markup for one or more bars of
          notes in single voice and staff. You can enter notes using a mouse,
          computer keyboard, or MIDI keyboard. This tool does not support
          editing existing LilyPond markup.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool can insert notes with their corresponding dynamics and
          markings. Keep an eye out for other tools that help generate LilyPond
          markup for other elements of sheet music!
        </p>
        <p>
          This tool only supports a small subset of LilyPond's features, but
          hopefully saves some time when transcribing music.
